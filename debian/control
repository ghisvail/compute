Description: cross-platform C++ library for GPU computing
 Boost.Compute is a GPU/parallel-computing library for C++ based on OpenCL.
 .
 The core library is a thin C++ wrapper over the OpenCL API and provides access
 to compute devices, contexts, command queues and memory buffers.
 .
 On top of the core library is a generic, STL-like interface providing common
 algorithms (e.g. transform(), accumulate(), sort()) along with common
 containers (e.g. vector<T>, flat_set<T>). It also features a number of
 extensions including parallel-computing algorithms (e.g. exclusive_scan(),
 scatter(), reduce()) and a number of fancy iterators (e.g.
 transform_iterator<>, permutation_iterator<>, zip_iterator<>). 
 .
 This package provides the development files for the standalone compute 
 package.
